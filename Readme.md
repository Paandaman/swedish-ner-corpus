# Swedish manually annotated NER

Webbnyheter 2012 from Spraakbanken, semi-manually annotated and adapted for CoreNLP Swedish NER. Semi-manually defined in this case as: Bootstrapped from Swedish Gazetters then manually correcte/reviewed by two independent native speaking swedish annotators. No annotator agreement calculated.

There might still be quality issues in the data and imbalanced classes. If you find errors pleas create a pull request.
